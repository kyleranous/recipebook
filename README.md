 # Recipe Book

 Recipe Book is a API for storing and retrieving recipes from a database. This project is being created specifically for integration into a Home Assistant Integration. 

 This project is purely an API service, all front-end and UI integrations for this project is managed by other applications. 

 Implementation of this project is being covered in the Home automation tutorial on my website (http://www.kranous.com/projects/home_automation/homeAutomation_00.html)
